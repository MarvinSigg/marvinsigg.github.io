# Welcome to my personal website!
I am Marvin Sigg, a master student in mathematics and physics based in Zurich, Switzerland. My supervisor is [Dr. Luke Conners](https://sites.google.com/view/lukegconners/home), we expect to inspect properties of Soergel bimodules. Before that, my major in my bachelor study was physics. I wrote my bachelor thesis in the [McMule group](https://mule-tools.gitlab.io/) at the PSI under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Adrian Signer.
My academic interests include abstract algebra in general and in particular finite group theory, category theory, representation theory, topology, set theory, and theoretical and mathematical physics. It is my goal to pursue a phd in higher abstract algebra in the near future.

You can find my thesis and student seminar papers [here](/files.md), and my CV [here](/cv.md).

Wanna get in touch? Contact me at marvin dot sigg at uzh dot ch. I am happy to talk about anything maths & physics related!
