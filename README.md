# Welcome to my personal website!
I am Marvin Sigg, a master student in mathematics and physics based in Zurich, Switzerland. My academic interests include abstract algebra in general and in particular finite group theory, category theory, representation theory, topology, set theory, and theoretical and mathematical physics. It is my dream to pursue a phd in any of those fields in the near future.

You can check out my thesis and student seminar papers [here](/files.md), and my CV [here](/cv.md) (under construction!).

Wanna get in touch? Contact me at marvin dot sigg at uzh dot ch. I am happy to talk about anything maths & physics related.
